"""
This is a very simple example aiming to show how variable scaling can be used.
Variable scaling is important for the conditioning of the problem thus it might improve for convergence.
This example is copied from the getting_started/pendulum.py example.

One scaling should be declared for each phase for the states and controls. The scaling of the parameters should be
declared in the parameter declaration like in the example getting_started/custom_parameters.py.

    The initialization of an ocp

    Parameters
    ----------
    biorbd_model_path: str
        The path to the biorbd model
    final_time: float
        The time in second required to perform the task
    n_shooting: int
        The number of shooting points to define int the direct multiple shooting program
    ode_solver: OdeSolverBase = OdeSolver.RK4()
        Which type of OdeSolver to use
    use_sx: bool
        If the SX variable should be used instead of MX (can be extensive on RAM)
    n_threads: int
        The number of threads to use in the paralleling (1 = no parallel computing)
    phase_dynamics: PhaseDynamics
        If the dynamics equation within a phase is unique or changes at each node.
        PhaseDynamics.SHARED_DURING_THE_PHASE is much faster, but lacks the capability to have changing dynamics within
        a phase. PhaseDynamics.ONE_PER_NODE should also be used when multi-node penalties with more than 3 nodes or with COLLOCATION (cx_intermediate_list) are added to the OCP.
    expand_dynamics: bool
        If the dynamics function should be expanded. Please note, this will solve the problem faster, but will slow down
        the declaration of the OCP, so it is a trade-off. Also depending on the solver, it may or may not work
        (for instance IRK is not compatible with expanded dynamics)
