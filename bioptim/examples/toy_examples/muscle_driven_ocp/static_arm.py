"""
This is a basic example on how to use biorbd model driven by muscle to perform an optimal reaching task.
The arms must reach a marker placed upward in front while minimizing the muscles activity

Please note that using show_meshes=True in the animator may be long due to the creation of a huge CasADi graph of the
mesh points.

    Prepare the ocp

    Parameters
    ----------
    biorbd_model_path: str
        The path to the bioMod
    final_time: float
        The time at the final node
    n_shooting: int
        The number of shooting points
    weight: float
        The weight applied to the SUPERIMPOSE_MARKERS final objective function. The bigger this number is, the greater
        the model will try to reach the marker. This is in relation with the other objective functions
    ode_solver: OdeSolverBase
        The ode solver to use
    phase_dynamics: PhaseDynamics
        If the dynamics equation within a phase is unique or changes at each node.
        PhaseDynamics.SHARED_DURING_THE_PHASE is much faster, but lacks the capability to have changing dynamics within
        a phase. PhaseDynamics.ONE_PER_NODE should also be used when multi-node penalties with more than 3 nodes or with COLLOCATION (cx_intermediate_list) are added to the OCP.
    expand_dynamics: bool
        If the dynamics function should be expanded. Please note, this will solve the problem faster, but will slow down
        the declaration of the OCP, so it is a trade-off. Also depending on the solver, it may or may not work
        (for instance IRK is not compatible with expanded dynamics)
    control_type: ControlType
        The type of control to use (CONSTANT, LINEAR_CONTROL, POLYNOMIAL_CONTROL)
    n_threads: int
        The number of threads to use in casadi (default: number of cores of your machine)

    Returns
    -------
    The OptimalControlProgram ready to be solved
