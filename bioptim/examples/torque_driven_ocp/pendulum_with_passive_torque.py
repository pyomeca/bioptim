"""
This is a clone of the example/getting_started/pendulum.py where a pendulum must be balance. The difference is that
this time there is a passive torque which is applied on Seg1 in the model "pendulum_with_passive_torque.bioMod".
The expression of the tau is therefore not the same here.

    The initialization of an ocp

    Parameters
    ----------
    biorbd_model_path: str
        The path to the biorbd model
    final_time: float
        The time in second required to perform the task
    n_shooting: int
        The number of shooting points to define int the direct multiple shooting program
    ode_solver: OdeSolverBase = OdeSolver.RK4()
        Which type of OdeSolver to use
    with_passive_torque: bool
        If the passive torque is used in dynamics
    phase_dynamics: PhaseDynamics
        If the dynamics equation within a phase is unique or changes at each node.
        PhaseDynamics.SHARED_DURING_THE_PHASE is much faster, but lacks the capability to have changing dynamics within
        a phase. A good example of when PhaseDynamics.ONE_PER_NODE should be used is when different external forces
        are applied at each node
    expand_dynamics: bool
        If the dynamics function should be expanded. Please note, this will solve the problem faster, but will slow down
        the declaration of the OCP, so it is a trade-off. Also depending on the solver, it may or may not work
        (for instance IRK is not compatible with expanded dynamics)
