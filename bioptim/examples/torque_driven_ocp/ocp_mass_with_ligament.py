    Prepare the ocp

    Parameters
    ----------
    biorbd_model_path: str
        The path to the bioMod
    use_sx: bool
        If the project should be build in mx [False] or sx [True]
    ode_solver: OdeSolverBase
        The type of integrator
    phase_dynamics: PhaseDynamics
        If the dynamics equation within a phase is unique or changes at each node.
        PhaseDynamics.SHARED_DURING_THE_PHASE is much faster, but lacks the capability to have changing dynamics within
        a phase. PhaseDynamics.ONE_PER_NODE should also be used when multi-node penalties with more than 3 nodes or with COLLOCATION (cx_intermediate_list) are added to the OCP.

    n_threads: int
        Number of threads to use
    expand_dynamics: bool
        If the dynamics function should be expanded. Please note, this will solve the problem faster, but will slow down
        the declaration of the OCP, so it is a trade-off. Also depending on the solver, it may or may not work
        (for instance IRK is not compatible with expanded dynamics)

    Returns

    The OptimalControlProgram ready to be solved
