"""
A very simple yet meaningful optimal control program consisting in a pendulum starting downward and ending upward
while requiring the minimum of generalized forces. The solver is only allowed to move the pendulum sideways.

This example is a good place to start investigating bioptim's time dependent problems as it describes a time dependent
torque driven dynamic, it defines an objective function and some boundaries and initial guesses

During the optimization process, the graphs are updated real-time (even though it is a bit too fast and short to really
appreciate it). Finally, once it finished optimizing, it animates the model using the optimal solution
