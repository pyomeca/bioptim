This is a clone of the example/getting_started/pendulum.py where a pendulum must be balance. The difference is that
the time to perform the task is now free for the solver to change. This example shows how to define such an optimal

    Prepare the optimal control program

    Parameters
    ----------
    biorbd_model_path: str
        The path to the bioMod
    final_time: float
        The initial guess for the final time
    n_shooting: int
        The number of shooting points
    time_min: float
        The minimal time the phase can have
    time_max: float
        The maximal time the phase can have
    ode_solver: OdeSolverBase
        The ode solver to use
    assume_phase_dynamics: bool
        If the dynamics equation within a phase is unique or changes at each node. True is much faster, but lacks the
        capability to have changing dynamics within a phase. A good example of when False should be used is when
        different external forces are applied at each node
    expand_dynamics: bool
        If the dynamics function should be expanded. Please note, this will solve the problem faster, but will slow down
        the declaration of the OCP, so it is a trade-off. Also depending on the solver, it may or may not work
        (for instance IRK is not compatible with expanded dynamics)
