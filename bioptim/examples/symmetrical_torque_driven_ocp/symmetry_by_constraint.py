"""
This trivial example has two rodes and must superimpose a marker on one rod at the beginning and another marker on the
same rod at the end, while keeping the degrees of freedom opposed. It does this by imposing the symmetry as a
proportional constraint (equals to -1).

The proportional constraint simply creates a constraint such that: state[i] = coef * state[j], where the coef is the
proportional constraint.

The difference between symmetry_by_mapping and symmetry_by_constraint is that one (mapping) removes the degree of
freedom from the solver, while the other (constraints) imposes a proportional constraint (equals to -1) so they
are opposed.
Please note that even though removing a degree of freedom seems a good idea, it is unclear if it is actually faster when
solving with IPOPT.
