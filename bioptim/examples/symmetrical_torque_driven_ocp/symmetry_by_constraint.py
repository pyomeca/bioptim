"""
This trivial example has two rodes and must superimpose a marker on one rod at the beginning and another marker on the
same rod at the end, while keeping the degrees of freedom opposed. It does this by imposing the symmetry as a
proportional constraint (equals to -1).

The proportional constraint simply creates a constraint such that: state[i] = coef * state[j], where the coef is the
proportional constraint.

The difference between symmetry_by_mapping and symmetry_by_constraint is that one (mapping) removes the degree of
freedom from the solver, while the other (constraints) imposes a proportional constraint (equals to -1) so they
are opposed.
Please note that even though removing a degree of freedom seems a good idea, it is unclear if it is actually faster when
solving with IPOPT.

    ----------
    biorbd_model_path: str
        Path to the bioMod
    ode_solver: OdeSolverBase
        The ode solver to use
    assume_phase_dynamics: bool
        If the dynamics equation within a phase is unique or changes at each node. True is much faster, but lacks the
        capability to have changing dynamics within a phase. A good example of when False should be used is when
        different external forces are applied at each node
    expand_dynamics: bool
        If the dynamics function should be expanded. Please note, this will solve the problem faster, but will slow down
        the declaration of the OCP, so it is a trade-off. Also depending on the solver, it may or may not work
        (for instance IRK is not compatible with expanded dynamics)
