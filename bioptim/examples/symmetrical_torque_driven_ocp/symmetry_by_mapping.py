"""
This trivial example has two rodes and must superimpose a marker on one rod at the beginning and another marker on the
same rod at the end, while keeping the degrees of freedom opposed. It does this by imposing the symmetry as a
mapping, that is by completely removing the degree of freedom from the solver variables but interpreting the numbers
properly when computing the dynamics

A BiMapping is used to link the degrees of freedom of the model to the optimization variables, that is converting a
vector of dimension M to dimension N, and vice versa. The way to understand the mapping is that if one is provided with
two vectors, what would be the correspondence between those vectors.
For instance, BiMapping([0, 1, None, 2, 2], [0, 1, 3], [4]) would mean that the first vector (v1) has 3 components and
to create it from a vector v2 of dimension 5 (using the [0, 1, 2] mapping), you would do: v1 = [v2[0], v2[1], v2[3]],
while ignoring the v2[2] and v2[4]. Conversely, the second v2 has 5 components and is created from the vector v1 of
dimension 3 using the [0, 1, None, 2, 2]/[4] mapping: v2 = [v1[0], v1[1], 0, v1[2], -v1[2]].
While used in dynamics, it is assumed that v1 is what is to be sent to biorbd (the full vector with all
the degrees of freedom), while v2 is the one sent to the solver (the one with less degrees of freedom).

The difference between symmetry_by_mapping and symmetry_by_constraint is that one (mapping) removes the degree of
freedom from the solver, while the other (constraints) imposes a proportional constraint (equals to -1) so they
are opposed.
Please note that even though removing a degree of freedom seems a good idea, it is unclear if it is actually faster when
solving with IPOPT.

Please note that while BiMapping is used in that context for reducing dof, it is only one of many more
applications one can do with the Mappings
