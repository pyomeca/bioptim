"""
This is a basic example on how to use biorbd model driven by muscle to perform an optimal reaching task.
The arms must reach a marker placed upward in front while minimizing the muscles activity

Please note that using show_meshes=True in the animator may be long due to the creation of a huge CasADi graph of the
mesh points.

    Prepare the ocp

    Parameters
    ----------
    biorbd_model_path: str
        The path to the bioMod
    final_time: float
        The time at the final node
    n_shooting: int
        The number of shooting points
    weight: float
        The weight applied to the SUPERIMPOSE_MARKERS final objective function. The bigger this number is, the greater
        the model will try to reach the marker. This is in relation with the other objective functions
    ode_solver: OdeSolverBase
        The ode solver to use
    assume_phase_dynamics: bool
        If the dynamics equation within a phase is unique or changes at each node. True is much faster, but lacks the
        capability to have changing dynamics within a phase. A good example of when False should be used is when
        different external forces are applied at each node
    expand_dynamics: bool
        If the dynamics function should be expanded. Please note, this will solve the problem faster, but will slow down
        the declaration of the OCP, so it is a trade-off. Also depending on the solver, it may or may not work
        (for instance IRK is not compatible with expanded dynamics)
