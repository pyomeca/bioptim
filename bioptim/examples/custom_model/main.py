    The initialization of an ocp

    Parameters
    ----------
    model: BioModel
        The object of the custom model
    final_time: float
        The time in second required to perform the task
    n_shooting: int
        The number of shooting points to define int the direct multiple shooting program
    configure_dynamics: callable
        The function to configure the dynamics
    ode_solver: OdeSolverBase = OdeSolver.RK4()
        Which type of OdeSolver to use
    assume_phase_dynamics: bool
        If the dynamics equation within a phase is unique or changes at each node. True is much faster, but lacks the
        capability to have changing dynamics within a phase. A good example of when False should be used is when
        different external forces are applied at each node
    n_threads: int
        Number of threads to use
    expand_dynamics: bool
        If the dynamics function should be expanded. Please note, this will solve the problem faster, but will slow down
        the declaration of the OCP, so it is a trade-off. Also depending on the solver, it may or may not work
        (for instance IRK is not compatible with expanded dynamics)
