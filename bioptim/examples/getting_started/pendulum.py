"""
A very simple yet meaningful optimal control program consisting in a pendulum starting downward and ending upward
while requiring the minimum of generalized forces. The solver is only allowed to move the pendulum sideways.

This simple example is a good place to start investigating bioptim as it describes the most common dynamics out there
(the joint torque driven), it defines an objective function and some boundaries and initial guesses

During the optimization process, the graphs are updated real-time (even though it is a bit too fast and short to really
appreciate it). Finally, once it finished optimizing, it animates the model using the optimal solution
