"""
A very simple yet meaningful optimal control program consisting in a pendulum starting downward and ending upward
while requiring the minimum of generalized forces. The solver is only allowed to move the pendulum sideways.

This simple example is a good place to start investigating bioptim as it describes the most common dynamics out there
(the joint torque driven), it defines an objective function and some boundaries and initial guesses

During the optimization process, the graphs are updated real-time (even though it is a bit too fast and short to really
appreciate it). Finally, once it finished optimizing, it animates the model using the optimal solution

    The initialization of an ocp

    Parameters
    ----------
    biorbd_model_path: str
        The path to the biorbd model
    final_time: float
        The time in second required to perform the task
    n_shooting: int
        The number of shooting points to define int the direct multiple shooting program
    ode_solver: OdeSolverBase = OdeSolver.RK4()
        Which type of OdeSolver to use
    use_sx: bool
        If the SX variable should be used instead of MX (can be extensive on RAM)
    n_threads: int
        The number of threads to use in the paralleling (1 = no parallel computing)
    assume_phase_dynamics: bool
        If the dynamics equation within a phase is unique or changes at each node. True is much faster, but lacks the
        capability to have changing dynamics within a phase. A good example of when False should be used is when
        different external forces are applied at each node
    expand_dynamics: bool
        If the dynamics function should be expanded. Please note, this will solve the problem faster, but will slow down
        the declaration of the OCP, so it is a trade-off. Also depending on the solver, it may or may not work
        (for instance IRK is not compatible with expanded dynamics)

    Returns
