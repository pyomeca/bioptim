"""
This example is a trivial box that must superimpose one of its corner to a marker at the beginning of the movement
and superimpose the same corner to a different marker at the end. While doing so, a force pushes the box upward.
The solver must minimize the force needed to lift the box while reaching the marker in time.
It is designed to show how to use external forces. An example of external forces that depends on the state (for
example a spring) can be found at 'examples/torque_driven_ocp/spring_load.py'

Please note that the point of application of the external forces are defined from the name of the segment in the bioMod.
It is expected to act on a segment in the global_reference_frame. BiorbdBioptim expect a list of list[segment_name, vector]
where the vector is a 6x1 array (Mx, My, Mz, Fx, Fy, Fz)
