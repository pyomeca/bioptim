"""
This is a clone of the getting_started/pendulum.py example.

It is designed to show how to create and solve a problem, and afterward, save it to the hard drive and reload it.

It shows an example of *.bo method and how to use the stand_alone boolean parameter of the save function. If set
to True, the variable dictionaries (states, controls and parameters) are saved instead of the full Solution class
itself. This allows to load the saved file into a setting where bioptim is not installed using the pickle package, but
prevents from using the class methods Solution offers after loading the file.

    assume_phase_dynamics: bool
        If the dynamics equation within a phase is unique or changes at each node. True is much faster, but lacks the
        capability to have changing dynamics within a phase. A good example of when False should be used is when
        different external forces are applied at each node
    expand_dynamics: bool
        If the dynamics function should be expanded. Please note, this will solve the problem faster, but will slow down
        the declaration of the OCP, so it is a trade-off. Also depending on the solver, it may or may not work
        (for instance IRK is not compatible with expanded dynamics)
