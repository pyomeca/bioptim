"""
This example mimics by essence what a jumper does which is maximizing the predicted height of the
center of mass at the peak of an aerial phase. It does so with a very simple two segments model though.
It is a clone of 'torque_driven_ocp/maximize_predicted_height_CoM.py' using
the option MINIMIZE_PREDICTED_COM_HEIGHT. It is different in the sense that the contact forces on ground have
to be downward (meaning that the object is limited to push on the ground, as one would expect when jumping, for
instance). Moreover, the lateral forces must respect some NON_SLIPPING constraint (that is the ground reaction
forces have to remain inside of the cone of friction).

It is designed to show how to use min_bound and max_bound values so they define inequality constraints instead
of equality constraints, which can be used with any ConstraintFcn

    Prepare the actual control program to be solved

    Parameters
    ----------
    biorbd_model_path
        The path to the dynamic biorbd model
    phase_time
        The time of the phase
    n_shooting
        The number of discretization points of the phase
    min_bound
        The minimal bound of the inequality constraint
    max_bound
        The maximal bound of the inequalit constraint
    mu
        The coefficient of friction to use in the simulation
    ode_solver
        The integrator solver to use
    assume_phase_dynamics: bool
        If the dynamics equation within a phase is unique or changes at each node. True is much faster, but lacks the
        capability to have changing dynamics within a phase. A good example of when False should be used is when
        different external forces are applied at each node
    expand_dynamics: bool
        If the dynamics function should be expanded. Please note, this will solve the problem faster, but will slow down
        the declaration of the OCP, so it is a trade-off. Also depending on the solver, it may or may not work
        (for instance IRK is not compatible with expanded dynamics)
