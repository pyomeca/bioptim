"""
This example is a trivial box that must superimpose one of its corner to a marker at the beginning of the movement
and superimpose the same corner to a different marker at the end. Moreover, the movement must be cyclic, meaning
that the states at the end and at the beginning are equal. It is designed to provide a comprehensible example of the way
to declare a cyclic constraint or objective function

A phase transition loop constraint is treated as hard penalty (constraint)
if weight is <= 0 [or if no weight is provided], or as a soft penalty (objective) otherwise

    Prepare the program

    Parameters
    ----------
    biorbd_model_path: str
        The path of the biorbd model
    final_time: float
        The time at the final node
    n_shooting: int
        The number of shooting points
    loop_from_constraint: bool
        If the looping cost should be a constraint [True] or an objective [False]
    ode_solver: OdeSolverBase
        The type of ode solver used
    assume_phase_dynamics: bool
        If the dynamics equation within a phase is unique or changes at each node. True is much faster, but lacks the
        capability to have changing dynamics within a phase. A good example of when False should be used is when
        different external forces are applied at each node
    expand_dynamics: bool
        If the dynamics function should be expanded. Please note, this will solve the problem faster, but will slow down
        the declaration of the OCP, so it is a trade-off. Also depending on the solver, it may or may not work
        (for instance IRK is not compatible with expanded dynamics)
