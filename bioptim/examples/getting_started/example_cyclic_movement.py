"""
This example is a trivial box that must superimpose one of its corner to a marker at the beginning of the movement
and superimpose the same corner to a different marker at the end. Moreover, the movement must be cyclic, meaning
that the states at the end and at the beginning are equal. It is designed to provide a comprehensible example of the way
to declare a cyclic constraint or objective function

A phase transition loop constraint is treated as hard penalty (constraint)
if weight is <= 0 [or if no weight is provided], or as a soft penalty (objective) otherwise
