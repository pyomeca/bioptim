"""
This example is a trivial box that must superimpose one of its corner to a marker at the beginning of the movement
and superimpose the same corner to a different marker at the end.
It is designed to show how one can define its own custom constraints function if the provided ones are not
sufficient.

More specifically this example reproduces the behavior of the SUPERIMPOSE_MARKERS constraint.

        PhaseDynamics.SHARED_DURING_THE_PHASE is much faster, but lacks the capability to have changing dynamics within
