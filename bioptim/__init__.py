"""
Bioptim is a direct multiple shooting optimal control program (ocp) framework for biomechanics based on biorbd.
It provides all the necessary tools to declare, modify, augment and solve an ocp.

Depending on the solver requested, normal and multiphase program, moving horizon estimator (MHE),
nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC), free time and parameter optimization, tracking, minimizing and maximizing
programs, from different joint torques and muscle driven dynamics can be solved.

Thanks to the CasADi backend of biorbd that allows to algorithmically differentiate the code, the descending gradient
algorithms are solving these highly nonlinear optimization program super efficiently. The Ipopt and ACADOS solvers
provide fast and robust solution for the optimal control program.

The examples provided cover a large spectrum of what bioptim is capable of, but is definitely not limited to. You will
find trivial example such balancing a pendulum upward up to arm movements controlled by the muscle EMG. The framework
has also been used gait tracking, hand prosthetic simulations, jumping simulation and violin movement optimization.
The latter being especially challenging because of the closed-loop involved in the kinematics.

So don't wait any further challenge biorbd to find you the best movement!

----------------------------------


Requirements and Installation
-----------------------------
bioptim requires minimally CasADi, [Ipopt, ACADOS], biorbd and bioviz. To install ACADOS, one is invited to have a look
at the installation script at 'external/acados_install.sh'. All the other requirements can be installed from conda
on the conda-forge channel using the following command:
`conda install -c conda-forge biorbd=*=*casadi* bioviz=*=*casadi*`

If one is interested in the conda-forge version of bioptim, they can install every requirements and bioptim using the
following command
`conda install -c conda-forge bioptim`


Examples
--------
Examples of all sort can be found in the 'examples' folder.
The first example one should have a look at is the example/getting_started/pendulum.py. This is a trivial yet
challenging optimal control problem. Once one is familiar with the bioptim nomenclature, it is suggested to have a look
at all the examples in 'examples/getting_started' which should tackle most of the questioning one could have when using
the bioptim API. For time optimization, one should have a look at the 'example/optimal_time_ocp' and some examples of
multiphase can be found in 'examples/torque_driven_ocp'. For ACADOS specific examples, you can have a look at
'example/acados'. Please note that ACADOS needs to be installed.
